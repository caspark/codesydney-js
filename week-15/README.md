Playing with Google Maps
========================

The project was to drop a marker at specified longitude and latitude, but that didn't seem too interesting.

This project shows the transit directions from Sydney, Australia to a user-specified location, using Google Maps' directions API.

Plain javascript -> not so pretty code for DOM manipulation, and I didn't put any effort into keeping things clean ;)
